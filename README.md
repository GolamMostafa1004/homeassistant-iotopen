📘 IoT Open – Home Assistant Integration

A custom Home Assistant integration for IoT Open (Lynx) that enables full interaction between your Lynx installation and Home Assistant using the REST API.

This integration allows you to:

🔗 Connect your IoT Open installation to Home Assistant

📡 Discover FunctionX objects as Home Assistant entities

📊 Retrieve live data via the Status API

🛠 Manage DeviceX and FunctionX directly from Home Assistant

🧩 Assign metadata, units, names, device IDs, icons, and more

The integration follows official Home Assistant development patterns, including config_flow, DataUpdateCoordinator, translations, and service definitions.

🚀 Features
🧱 Data Model

One HA config entry = one IoT Open installation

DeviceX → Physical devices in IoT Open (e.g., KNX gateways, IoT controllers, sensor hubs)

FunctionX → Logical datapoints (temperature, humidity, switch, boolean, etc.)

Status API → Retrieves live values based on topic_read

📥 What the Integration Does

Uses IoT Open API v2 over HTTPS with X-API-Key authentication

Periodically:

Lists FunctionX for the installation

Reads meta.topic_read for each function

Fetches latest status samples

Creates/updates Home Assistant entities

Automatically groups entities:

If meta.device_id is set → entities grouped under the correct DeviceX

Otherwise → grouped under the Installation device

🛠 Manage IoT Open from Home Assistant

The integration exposes HA services that let you perform platform maintenance directly from Home Assistant:

➕ Create DeviceX

➖ Delete DeviceX

➕ Create FunctionX

➖ Delete FunctionX

🔗 Assign FunctionX → DeviceX via meta.device_id

🏷 Set metadata on both DeviceX and FunctionX (name, unit, icon, public, etc.)

This makes it possible to automate IoT Open management using HA automations and scripts.

📋 Requirements

Home Assistant 2023.12+

Python environment provided by Home Assistant

IoT Open / Lynx account with:

Access to an installation

Valid API key (X-API-Key) with read/write permissions

<config>/
  custom_components/
    iotopen/
      __init__.py
      manifest.json
      const.py
      api.py
      coordinator.py
      sensor.py
      config_flow.py
      services.yaml
      translations/
        en.json
        sv.json
        de.json
        fr.json
        ar.json

2️⃣ Restart Home Assistant

After copying the folder, restart Home Assistant.

3️⃣ Add the Integration

In Home Assistant:

Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → IoT Open


Enter:

Base URL

Installation ID

API Key

Home Assistant will now automatically discover all FunctionX items and create entities.
